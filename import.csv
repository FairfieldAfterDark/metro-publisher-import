"<p>Rise Recovery started as the San Antonio office of Palmer Drug Abuse Program (PDAP), which opened in November 1977 when Reverend (now Bishop) John McNaughton of Christ Episcopal Church learned of the success of the PDAP groups in Houston and Dallas. What most impressed Rev. McNaughton was that PDAP was based on spiritual principles rather than a specific religion, and, most notably, that the organization did not charge for services.</p>",29.5341947|-98.5582728,"The purpose of Rise Recovery is to carry our love and understanding to others, and to practice the principles of love and honesty in our daily lives, with the help of God, as we understand Him.",,,4726206,29.5341947,-98.5582728,,78230,210-227-2634,published,Ironside,10226,Rise Recovery,a4628154-fc71-11e5-bde7-22000b078648,http://www.riserecovery.org/
